Coursework for the Data Mining I held at ETHZ in 2022. 

The overall structure of the repository is the following:
```
.
└── homework [1-5]/
    ├── code/
    │   ├── assignment.pdf
    │   ├── data/
    │   └── scripts, etc.
    └── report
```
Where the ```code/``` and any afferent ```scripts``` or ```data/``` folders will or will not exist depending on the assignment
